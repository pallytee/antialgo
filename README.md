# Anti-Algo

A creative-code tool that subverts platform censorship through Unicode glyph manipulation.
Anti-Algo formalizes activist folk tactics to reveal how political language is constrained—and rerouted—under algorithmic moderation.

## What it does
- Takes an input phrase and generates “visually similar” variants using Unicode homoglyphs / diacritics
- Helps users understand how moderation systems can be bypassed (and why that matters)
- Makes the politics of legibility visible: what gets flagged, what passes, and what gets distorted

## Why
Platforms often suppress or down-rank certain political terms. People adapt with improvisational typography.
Anti-Algo treats that adaptation as a design-research artifact: a record of constraint, creativity, and survival.

## Notes
- This repo is a prototype intended for demonstration and research discussion.
- If you see `.env.local.example`, copy it to `.env.local` and fill in values as needed.

## Ethics
This project is presented as critique and documentation of censorship dynamics, not as a promise of evasion.
